    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>FortiFIRE was designed to raise awareness for global warming, specifically, its role in forest fires. It may come as a surprise that natural wildfires actually are not all that bad for the environment. In fact, when contained, wildfires “reset the clock” for the ecosystem, allowing it to thrive for a few more hundred years. However, problems arise when these fires begin to spiral out of control, destroying homes and killing people. Scientists have found that human-caused global warming is increasing the size and intensity of forest fires. Our goal is to bring awareness to the harmful effects of global warming and the need for its prevention, for half of Americans don’t believe that climate changes will have an impact on them personally.</p>

        <p>The Ash Wednesday Bushfires were a series of fires that raged in Australia beginning on February 16, 1983. More than 180 fires burned within the span of twelve hours, burning a total of 1,284,948 acres of land. 3,700 buildings were burned which caused 2,545 people to lose their homes. Over 130,000 firefighters were called to action and a total of 1.3 billion dollars was the total for the repair of all damages.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, February 7th, 2009, hundreds of fires raged across Victoria, Australia on a day that became known as Black Saturday. These fires claimed the lives of 173 people and destroyed almost 2,0000 homes. Although the causes of the blazes ranged from fallen power lines to arson, a major drought and heatwave created the perfect storm.</p>

        <p>In October of 2017, fires tore through Santa Rosa, California, killing 23 people and destroying hundreds of homes. In fact, it became one of the most disastrous wildfires in California's history. The Coffeey Park neighborhood in Santa Rosa is depicted,
          where dozens of homes were reduced to ash and rubble. The final cost to repair all of the damage caused by the destructive blaze was 1.2 billion dollars.</p>

        <p>On the afternoon of July 23, 2018, a fire broke out in Mati, Greece. A main road along the sea was filled with burnt cars. More than 80 cars were completely destroyed and roads were turned into carpets of ash. According to Greek reports, 80 people were killed, 200 injured, and 1,500 homes damaged. The blaze devastated entire villages, forcing
        hundreds to flee towards the sea to escape the fire but those who could not run fast enough succumbed to their burns. Intense winds up to 60 mph fanned the flames, making it difficult for firefighters to tackle the fires. It became Greece's worst fire disaster since 2007, when dozens were killed in the Peloponnesian peninsula.
